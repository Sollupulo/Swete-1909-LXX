# Swete-1909-LXX
An accurate digital version of Swete's 1909 Septuagint

Special thanks go out to Eliran Wong (https://github.com/eliranwong/LXX-Swete-1930)
for providing the OCR scans. Without throwing shade upon him, there were many
errors in the files due to the low DPI of the original PDF files. These are being
corrected through various Python scripts and manual proofreading with corroboration
from the PDF files.

Swete 1909 LXX is public domain and the PDFs used can be found at:

Also, a special mention goes out to André von Kugland
(https://github.com/kugland/Sublime-BetaCode/blob/master/BetaCode.py#L1)
for developing the beta code module for Sublime Text Editor, which made typing in
polytonic Greek on an American English keyboard so seemless.

As this is a work in progress, files are added as each book of Swete's LXX are
proofread.
